  <p><strong>Patalyze</strong> is an experimental project exploring publicly available patent data.</p>
  <p>With on average XXX patents being published every week by the USPTO in 2013 we believe there are interesting questions that can by answered by that data. Who are the most active patent authors for companies like Apple or Tesla? Do they file patents with people outside of their respective companies? What are those companies? </p>
  <p>There are many more questions we want to answer. <a href="http://google.com">Follow along as we do.</a></p>
