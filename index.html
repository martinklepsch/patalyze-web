  <p>Patalyze is an experimental project exploring publicly available patent data.</p>
  <p>
    With XXXXXs of patents being published every day by the USPTO we believe there
    are some interesting questions that can by answered by that data. Which people are
    the most active patent authors for companies like Apple or Tesla? Do they file
    patents with people outside of their respective companies? What are those companies?
  </p>
  <p>There are many more questions we want to answer. Follow us on our journey.</p>
